# ✈️ 1. Tool Overview

## SBSCAN: (If you think this project is good, then click 🌟 🤩)

**SBSCAN is a penetration testing tool specifically designed for the Spring framework, capable of scanning specified sites for Spring Boot sensitive information and verifying related Spring vulnerabilities.**

- **Comprehensive Sensitive Path Dictionary**: The most comprehensive sensitive path dictionary for Spring Boot sites, helping you thoroughly check whether your site is exposed to sensitive information leakage.
- **Supports Fingerprint Detection**:
  - Supports Spring Site Fingerprint Matching: Enable fingerprint identification to continue scanning only if the Spring fingerprint is detected, saving resources and time (sites without this feature may be missed, so use at your discretion).
  - Supports Sensitive Path Page Keyword Fingerprint Matching: By maintaining keyword features contained in sensitive paths, it performs fingerprint matching on the detected pages, greatly improving the tool’s detection accuracy and reducing the time needed for manual verification of sensitive pages.
- **Supports Specified Module Detection**: Don’t want to scan for vulnerabilities but only want to check sensitive paths? Or maybe just want to scan for vulnerabilities? You can specify modules using the `-m` parameter.
- **Most Comprehensive Spring Vulnerability Detection POC**: All CVE vulnerability detection POCs related to Spring are integrated into this tool, making it the most comprehensive of its kind.
- **Solution for Non-Reflective Vulnerabilities**: Non-reflective vulnerability detection based on response status codes alone isn’t reliable? You can specify a DNSLog domain using the `--dnslog` parameter. The vulnerability is truly verified if DNSLog records are observed.
- **Noise Reduction Output**: You can specify the `-q` parameter to display only successful detection results.
- **Friendly Extensibility**: During the initial project design, user custom extension requirements were considered. The project adopts a high-cohesion, low-coupling modular programming approach, allowing you to easily add your own POCs, sensitive paths, and bypass statements, as well as optimize detection logic. For more details, see the "Custom Extensions" section below.
- **Other Common Supports**: Single URL scanning / URL file scanning / scan module selection / proxy support / multi-threading / scan report generation

```
sbscan [option]
```

## 🎡 Options

```bash
BashCopy code
-u, --url                              Scan a single URL
-f, --file                             Scan targets from a file containing URLs
-m, --mode                             Specify the scanner mode[path/cve/all],default all
-p, --proxy                            Specify an HTTP proxy
-t, --threads                          Specify the number of threads
-q, --quiet                            Enable clean output, only display sensitive path hits
-ff, --fingerprint_filter              Enable fingerprint detection, only the sites that detect spring fingerprints will be scanned in the next step (it may cause missing reports, please select whether to enable it according to the actual situation
--dnslog                               Specify an DNSLog domain
--help                                 Display help information
```

## 🎨 Examples

```bash
BashCopy code
# Scan a specific target URL
$ python3 sbscan.py -u http://test.com
# Scan files, and URLs that do not match the fingerprint will skip the next step of detection
$ python3 sbscan.py -f url.txt --ff
# Only perform vulnerability scanning on the target and only output the hit CVEs
$ python3 sbscan.py -f url.txt -m cve --quiet
# Specify target URL, proxy, and thread count
$ python3 sbscan.py -u http://test.com -p 1.1.1.1:8888 -t 10
# Specify target URL, enable quiet output, display only hit sensitive paths or CVEs, enable fingerprint detection for scanning matching fingerprint sites
$ python3 sbscan.py -u http://test.com --quiet -ff
# Specify url file path, specify dnslog domain name, use 10 threads for concurrent scanning, and enable clean output
$ python3 sbscan.py -f url.txt -t 4 -d 5pugcrp1.eyes.sh --quiet
```

## 🧩 Custom extension
- Added vulnerability detection: scan the scanner/cve_scanners directory and program the detection logic according to other cve formats. Pay attention to the consistent format of function naming, parameter receiving, and return, and then add parameters in the config/cve.json format
- Added path detection: in config/ Path. json, configure the path and the characteristic string of the path page in dictionary format (none can be left empty).
