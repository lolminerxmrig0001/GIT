# Introduction

This Automated Vulnerability Scanner (AVS) is a network-level scanner created for educational purposes. It checks for known vulnerabilities and provides output indicating whether specific exploits can be executed on the target system. The AVS operates by sending predefined rules to the network and recording and evaluating the responses.

# Features

-   Identify known vulnerabilities within a target system.
-   Provide console-based feedback on exploit executability.
-   Easy-to-use interface for educational purposes.

# Installation

Please follow these steps to install and set up the AVS:

-   Clone the repository to your local machine:
-   git clone https://github.com/WillMartin03/Automated-Vulnerability-Scanner.git
-   Open repository directory
-   Run the executable file (python ./AVS.py)

# Usage

To run the Automated Vulnerability Scanner, follow these steps:

    Navigate to the AVS directory in your terminal.
    Execute the scanner using the following command:
    python ./AVS.py

# Runtime

This project performs a full audit on a system on all open ports that are found during your scan.
Depending on how many open ports are found, the scan can take quite some time. That being said, it is not feasible to rely on this module to be stealthy or quick.
Remember to have the proper authorization before using this anywhere that isn't your own devices, and have patience for results!

# Author

This project was created on October 27th, 2023 by [William Martin](https://github.com/PlayersZero) as a simple project for network scanning. This project was presented as a finalized version for my cybersecurity mentorship to a small group to showcase how it works and what I learned. Special thank you to my mentor, [Steve Morin](https://github.com/srmorin) for assisting me in this project and teaching me invaluable concepts that I would otherwise have missed out on. Project development ran approximately from _October 5th, 2023 to December 23th. 2023_ (~79 days).
