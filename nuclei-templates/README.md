## Overview

This is a nuclei template designed for detecting CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) injection vulnerabilities. CRLF injection vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can manipulate or inject CRLF characters into an application's input, often leading to various security issues such as HTTP response splitting, header injection, or even remote code execution.

This nuclei template is an extended version of the template originally created by [Oralyzer](https://github.com/r0075h3ll/Oralyzer). It's designed to identify instances where CRLF sequences are not properly sanitized or handled by a web application.
