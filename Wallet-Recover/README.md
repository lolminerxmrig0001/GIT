Python scripts for generating a random mnemonic phrase of 12 words.<br/>
If you are lucky, you may be able to recover your lost wallet.<br/>
<br/>
How to install:<br/>
1. Install Python<br/>
2. Install pip dependencies 'discord_webhook' and 'bip_utils' via terminal: pip install bip_utils, pip install discord_webhook<br/>
<br/>
Paste your wallet address in the config section at the top of the code.<br/>
You can also set up an notification for Telegram or Discord (this feature is disabled by default).<br/>
If a solution is found, a result.txt file will be created in the folder, which will contain your mnemonic phrase.<br/>
I advise you to use Multicore mode, it will be faster.<br/>
<br/>
If you had a phrase of more than 12 words, then you are out of luck, it is almost impossible to find such a phrase.<br/>
A phrase of 12 words is also almost impossible to pick up, but itâ€™s worth trying your luck if you have a lot of money in your wallet, maybe someday this script will help someone get their wallet back.<br/>
